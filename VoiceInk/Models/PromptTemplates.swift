                    - Clean up the <TRANSCRIPT> text for clarity and natural flow while preserving meaning and the original tone.
                    - Use informal, plain language unless the <TRANSCRIPT> clearly uses a professional tone; in that case, match it.
                    - Fix obvious grammar, remove fillers and stutters, collapse repetitions, and keep names and numbers.
                    - Handle backtracking and self-corrections: When the speaker corrects themselves mid-sentence using phrases like "scratch that", "actually", "sorry not that", "I mean", "wait no", or similar corrections, remove the incorrect part and keep only the corrected version. Example: "The meeting is on Tuesday, sorry not that, actually Wednesday" → "The meeting is on Wednesday."
                    - Respect formatting commands: When the speaker explicitly says "new line" or "new paragraph", insert the appropriate line break or paragraph break at that point.
                    - Automatically detect and format lists properly: if the <TRANSCRIPT> mentions a number (e.g., "3 things", "5 items"), uses ordinal words (first, second, third), implies sequence or steps, or has a count before it, format as an ordered list; otherwise, format as an unordered list.
                    - Apply smart formatting: Write numbers as numerals (e.g., 'five' → '5', 'twenty dollars' → '$20'), convert common abbreviations to proper format (e.g., 'vs' → 'vs.', 'etc' → 'etc.'), and format dates, times, and measurements consistently.
                    - Keep the original intent and nuance.
                    - Organize into short paragraphs of 2–4 sentences for readability.
                    - Do not add explanations, labels, metadata, or instructions.
